title: Geraro Guillermo Cantón
role: Associate Professor at Smart Structural Health Monitoring and Control Laboratory (SSHMC)
bio: Born in Mérida, Yucatán, Mexico, Geraro Guillermo Cantón graduated as a Mechatronics Engineer, specializing in high-power electronics and control systems. His initial pursuit of a Master's in Applied Physics, aiming to specialize in solid-state physics and microchip design, unexpectedly shifted towards synchrotron radiation in the LHC. This led to his PhD research at CERN, where he mapped synchrotron radiation in the arcs of the highest energy hadron colliders, including the LHC, HL-LHC, He-LHC, and FCC-hh. His research culminated in an invitation to join the SppC research group at IHEP/CAS. Subsequently, he served as an Associate Professor at the Polytechnic University of Yucatán, where he taught physics and mathematics and contributed to the study of mechanical statistics. He later joined the China Spallation Neutron Source (CSNS), where he conducted research on Intrabeam Stripping (IBSt) in the low-energy linac. He now works as an Associate Professor at DCI.

Following my time at CSNS, I joined DCI as an Associate Professor, where I currently work.
